# Firefox Personalized Alarms Add-on Tutorial

Code repository for a SitePoint tutorial on how to create a Firefox add-on.

The finished add-on allows the user to create reocurring alarms, triggered at specified times with custom text. 

It can be installed from the [Firefox Browser Add-ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/personalized-alarms/)
